<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>ðŸ“ŒGreetings! I'm Krishna Jotwani, a driven individual hailing from a family of go-getters. My journey into the professional world commenced early on, fueled by a relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>

  <p>ðŸ“ŒAfter conquering the rigorous challenges of IIT-JEE and earning my spot at NIT Nagpur, life threw unexpected curveballs when our family bio-fertilizer business faced a significant downturn in sales during my first year of engineering. Stepping up to the challenge, I took the reins, initiating a transformative journey that saw me rebranding our products and tapping into the untapped potential of rural markets.</p>
  
  <p>ðŸ“ŒBreaking away from conventional norms, I pioneered the integration of digital marketing alongside traditional methods, leading to remarkable results and a revitalization of our business. This experience instilled in me the profound value of personal relationships in retail sales and ignited a fervent passion for entrepreneurship.</p>
  
    <p>ðŸ“ŒPost-graduation, I embarked on a new chapter at A Globia Creations, where I seamlessly merged my technological acumen with the company's prowess in interior design to pioneer digital classroom projects. Through our collective efforts, we've successfully established over 200 digital classrooms in Maharashtra, India, catering to underprivileged schools. These projects not only bolstered company revenue but also catalyzed a remarkable 20% improvement in the academic performance of disadvantaged children.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ“ŒMy journey is far from over. With an unwavering commitment to innovation and a thirst for entrepreneurial success, I aspire to further hone my skills at Babson College, USA, with the ultimate goal of founding a unicorn startup that leaves a lasting impact on society.</p>
